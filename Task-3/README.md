Got it, Loki! Here‚Äôs the **complete README.md** **without the interview questions**, including the wall section, project structure, features, OOP concepts, how to run, sample console outputs, and notes‚Äîall in **a single Markdown block** ready to copy-paste:

# üìö Library Management System

**Library Management System** is a simple console-based application built using **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It allows managing books and users, and supports operations like issuing and returning books.

This project demonstrates key OOP principles including **encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, dynamic binding**, and **composition**, providing a solid foundation for understanding real-world object-oriented design.

---

### üìù Key Highlights

- Manage library books with unique IDs, titles, and authors.
- Register and track library users.
- Issue books to users and return them efficiently.
- View all books and users with current issue status.
- Fully implemented using OOP concepts for easy scalability and extension.

## üõ† Features

1. **Add Books** ‚Äì Store book details such as ID, title, and author.
2. **Add Users** ‚Äì Register library users with unique IDs.
3. **Issue Book** ‚Äì Assign a book to a user if available.
4. **Return Book** ‚Äì Return issued books back to the library.
5. **View Books** ‚Äì Display all books with their status (issued or available).
6. **View Users** ‚Äì Display all registered users and their issued books.

## ‚ö° Key OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with getter/setter methods in `Book` and `User`.
- **Abstraction:** The `Library` class abstracts library operations (add, issue, return, display).
- **Polymorphism:** Methods like `issueBook()` and `returnBook()` operate on different objects (`Book`, `User`).
- **Dynamic Binding:** Method calls like `book.display()` and `user.display()` are resolved at runtime.
- **Composition (‚ÄúHAS-A‚Äù relationship):** `User` has a list of `Book` objects representing issued books.

> **Note:** In this implementation, we use **composition** rather than inheritance because `Book` is not extended.

## üìå How to Run

1. Open your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ/VS Code) and create a Java project.
2. Copy all the `.java` files (`Book.java`, `User.java`, `Library.java`, `Main.java`) into your project folder.
3. Compile and run `Main.java`.
4. Follow the console prompts to **add users**, **add books**, **issue**, or **return books**.

## üìù Notes

- Each book has a **unique ID**.
- Users must be registered **before issuing books**.
- Multiple books can be issued to a user.
- If a book is already issued, it cannot be issued again until returned.
